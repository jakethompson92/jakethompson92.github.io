title: About me
---

I am a behavioral macroeconomist who received a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oregon. I received dual Bachelors degrees in Economics and Philosophy from Kent State University. I study macroeconomics with a particular emphasis on Bayesian DSGE models. In my job market paper, I explore the importance of agents' first beliefs in a DSGE model with boundedly-rational agents. I document the gains in model likelihood that one can achieve through joint estimation of initial beliefs along with model parameters.
