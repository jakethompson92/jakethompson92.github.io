title: About me
---

I am a behavioral macroeconomist with a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oregon and dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Philosophy from Kent State University. My research centers on macroeconomic modeling, with a focus on Bayesian DSGE models and the role of belief formation in shaping economic dynamics. In my job market paper, I investigate how jointly estimating agents' initial beliefs and model parameters in a boundedly rational DSGE framework improves model fit and forecasting performance.

I recently completed a teaching-focused appointment at Illinois State University, where I taught macro- and microeconomics while leveraging data platforms and digital tools to enhance student learning. I am currently exploring new opportunities in academic, policy, or private-sector roles that involve applied economic research, data-driven decision-making, or economic analysis.
