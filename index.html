I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Oregon. Before starting my PhD studies I received dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Philosophy from Kent State University. 
My research focuses on macroeconomics, particularly on Bayesian DSGE models. In my job market paper, I explore the importance of agents' initial beliefs in a DSGE model with boundedly-rational agents.
Having worked in an educational capacity for nearly a decade, I have experience at both the college and grade-school levels. My strong passion for economics education is complemented by a wide breadth of experience with students from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of preparedness.
