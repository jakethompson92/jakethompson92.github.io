I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Oregon. I received dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Philosophy from Kent State University. My research focuses on macroeconomics, particularly on Bayesian DSGE models. In my job market paper, I explore the importance of agents' initial beliefs in a DSGE model with boundedly-rational agents.
