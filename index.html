I am a behavioral macroeconomist with a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oregon and dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Philosophy from Kent State University. My research centers on macroeconomic modeling, with a focus on Bayesian DSGE models and the role of belief formation in shaping economic dynamics. In my job market paper, I investigate how jointly estimating agents' initial beliefs and model parameters in a boundedly rational DSGE framework improves model fit and forecasting performance.

I currently serve as a Visiting Lecturer at Northeastern University, where I teach macroeconomics at the introductory, intermediate, and master's level while leveraging data platforms and digital tools to enhance student learning. I am currently exploring new opportunities in academic, policy, or private-sector roles that involve applied economic research, data-driven decision-making, or macroeconomic analysis.
